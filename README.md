# klipper-config

*This is currently untested*

This is my klipper config for a Creality Ender 3 with an SKR v1.3. I use a Raspberry Pi 4B running my [docker image](https://github.com/seanauff/OctoPrint-Klipper) with Octoprint and Klipper.

I also include the firmware, but I recommend you compile your own.
